# Hospital Patient Management System
A general pre-triage application for a hospital using object oriented techniques to:
register or admit patients in the lineup
manage incoming patients by letting them select COVID test or Triage categories
create a ticket for each patient while also storing its data (name, OHIP number, symptoms) in a
comma-separated file
calculate wait time for the patients in the lineup
